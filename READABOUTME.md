## About me
My name is Gerald Celestine. Currently, I am pursuing a career change to become a Software Tester. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to demonstrate my skills in this career path. In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning and I will continue to update this repo. As a professional in this field, I am determined to demonstrate my skills and continue to develop them, because of this, I'm looking for opportunities in testing to continue to grow and evolve.

<!-- ## My Experience
My experience varies from IT Support Specialist to Software Development and Software Testing/QA.
In my career I have participated in two projects where I was able to test software as a user. In both cases I did not have any test cases or scenarios prepared, I have been following processes and using my experience. Bugs found by me was reported using JIRA.-->
